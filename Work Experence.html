					<h3>Computers</h3>
							<p>
								Actually i was working in my own store in Egypt Every day I was installing operating systems over 8 or more a day and fixing more than computers a day also I was making an Internet group, it's basically you go and have a contract with a company then you put the router in the store then connect other people with your Internet I was connecting about 200 one on my own network every month they were pay me and if some one didn't pay he can't get Internet.
                                The company was doing an offer that every one need to have a username and a password. Many people love that so I did it at this program it was showing me what is happening on my network if some one didn't pay I go on the program and don't give the computer an internet access untill that person pay.
                                After my network was successful I had increased and upgraded my speed and made a homegroup I was sharing on my network games, films, music, photos and programs after that more people entered my network. 
                                In Austria I was selling all computer parts, operating systems, programs, games and anything related to computer.

					<h3>Cars and Garage</h3>
							<p>
								I worked for a garage that have many cars I was helping the people to decide which car they want. This was in Egypt last year this place was very successful so I went to work there. I love cars like Ferrari, Lamborgine and Buggati these are my best cars.
                                The garage is a big place that cars stand in it every day I was driving 3 or 7 cars to put them at the garage it is a very secure place.
                                When the revolution began I left that job because it is scary when you are at your job and some people come and fired at the place that is so scary some people were died at that place at that day I was having a holiday I heard that there was people killed at that place.
